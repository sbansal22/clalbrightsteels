      <h1 class="w3-wide"><b>FAQ's</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        <font size="4"><b>What is Bright Bar?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Bright Bar can be made either by cold drawing, peeling or centerless grinding. As such a typical
          bright bar can be either drawn, peeled or ground or a combination of any or all the processes. <br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>What is its source?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Hot rolled wire rods and bars from a variety of steel plants. The steel can be made available in
          Single / Double Rolled, Billet / Bloom Route, Hot Rolled, Soft Annealed, Spherodized Annealed,
          Normalized.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>Why a bright bar?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">A. As because hot-rolled bars have a large tolerance in diameter, ovality, and length cold bright
          bars can be provided with much closer tolerances.<br><br>
          B. Hot-rolled wire rods come is specified sizes, but bright can be made available to almost any size as
          desired.<br><br>
          C. As because hot rolled products have a scale on it as well as rough surface, Bright Bars are free of any
          scale and are bright in appearance.<br><br>
          D. Bright bars from the same source can be made available having different mechanical properties to suit
          different needs.<br><br>
          E. Bright bars are an intermediate product which is further processed for specific items like auto-components,
          machined parts, forging and so<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>What are the ground bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">When a layer of the outer surface is removed by processing it on centerless grinders, this
          process is known as grinding and the product ground bars. Single cut can grind upto 0.10 mm.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>What is the source?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Cold Drawn and or peeled Bars.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>Why ground bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">A. To achieve tight Dia. tolerance of 0.04 mm.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">B. For those components where Zero Surface defect is required as it removes minor Cracks, Seems,
          Dents and Pitting etc.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">C. Grinding is also must for the components which demands very good cosmetic look and / or
          plating is done.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>What are peeled bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Peeling is the removal of the outer surface of Bars utilizing rotating tool bits. Single cut can
          turn 1 - 2 mm.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>Why Peeled bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Surface defects are deeper and proportional to the diameter of bars. In large diameters removal
          of such defects is done by peeling wherein a deeper cut can be given. It is also feasible to attain the
          objective by grinding but it will take too many cuts to be carried out which is un-economic. Peeling leaves
          minor turning marks on the surface so often customers prefer to have Peeled and Ground bars.<br>
          <br>
        </font>
        <font size="4"><b>What are shaped wires and bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">Other than regular round a host of special sections like Hexagons, Octagons, Squares, D , Double
          D can be drawn. If it is in the form of Wire it is Shaped Wire and if in Bar form then it is Shaped
          Bar.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>Why shaped wires and bars?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">A. Cold-formed shaped products provide customers with the shape which otherwise would have to be
          done by machining.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">B. It saves material wastage and hence costs.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">C. Reduction in the number of processes that would have otherwise been used saves in costs, space
          and investment as well as lead time.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">D. It can be supplied in Wire form if the customer has the continuous feeding process in their
          production line.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">E. As it is cold formed so the metallurgical integrity is an added advantage over achieving the
          shape by machining.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">F. The surface is bright and in exact shape and size so it can be directly processed for
          components like circlips and springs.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>Quite often it is found that the surface of bright bars gets rusty. Can this be taken care
            of?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">The exposed surface of cold drawn bars is very sensitive to surface degradation by way of
          corrosion. Corrosion is aggravated by the following factors:<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">A. Moisture in air<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">B. Temperature<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">C. Exposure to a corrosive environment.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">D. Amount of cold reduction To take care of this, rust preventive oil is applied to the finished
          bars. This oil comes in various grades and utility.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">E. For material that is intended to be used up within a week, solvent-based rust preventive oil
          is used.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">F. For a longer shelf life say 30 days or more a lube based rust preventive oil can be
          used.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">G. For material that requires protection for a shorter period but does not require oil on it for
          various reasons, dry or semi-dry film based oil fortified with corrosive inhibitors can be used.<br><br>
        </font>
        <font size="3">H. For the export market where a sea-worthy packing is required, we do have the option of
          wrapping each bar with either polythene film or paper which is coated with non-toxic volatile corrosion
          inhibitors.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">I. Even bright bars can be oiled and packed in polypropylene packets to improve shelf
          life.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">J. However, it should be remembered that all these efforts can delay the process of corrosion by
          providing a finite shelf life but can never stop corrosion.<br><br></font>
        <font size="4"><b>If I ask for bright bars of say 18 mm diameter with % C 0.40 – 0.50 and % Mn 0.50 – 0.90, what
            will you supply me?</b><br></font>
        <font size="3">You have asked a very pertinent question as we do get a lot of orders as such. In such case we
          will supply you cold drawn bright bars as under:<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">A. Supply will be as per the available steel whose ladle analysis will conform to the chemistry
          provided by you. The relevant grades are EN-8D, EN-43B, AISI 1041 – 1046, IS C-40, IS C-45, JIS S43 – S48, DIN
          Ck-45.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">B. The diameter will remain in between 17.91 – 18 mm.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">C. The length will be between 2750 – 2800 mm.<br><br></font>
        <font size="3">D. It will be smeared with solvent-based rust preventive oil whose shelf life is 30 days.<br><br>
        </font>
        <font size="3">E. The bright bar packet will be almost 1 MT in weight and will be tied at two points by annealed
          wires. The packet will be dispatched without any packaging if the consignee is in the National Capital
          Territory of India. For outstation customers, this bright bar packet will be wrapped with a polypropylene
          sheet and loaded in a truck having a waterproof canvas.<br><br></font>
